Uptown_Buck,"Lets be real. We got people burning Nike gear just because they put Kaepernick in an ad campaign. If an NFL team actually put him in a game again, the crowd would make what Jackie Robinson went through look tame. In 2018 no less.  https://twitter.com/AdamSerwer/status/1039175013478354944"

JJLTeach,@seanhannity Whoops.....   I would venture to guess this is just the beginning.  Still confuses me that Nike is standing up for the alleged oppression when they make their products in impoverished countries.

SekaiFarai,A colleague asked me what I thought about the Nike - Kaepernick situation and all I could muster was to repeatedly say disgusting. Its so hard for me to speak fluently off the cuff. It takes me longer than a couple beats to get the thought out.
